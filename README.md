# Comp

Comp is a simpel script to make your workflow better while working on small C++ projekts.

## Description

With gpp-wrapper (comp) you can directly compile your C++ file to a output directory, 
and comp will automaticly execute the generated file for you!
You can also provide any options directly to g++!

## Installation

The only thing you need to do is to add the "comp.sh" file to your path 
(meaning /usr/local/bin/, or /usr/bin/, or some other path on your $PATH variable)



If you have any suggestions, Improvment, or questions about comp, please let me know!
